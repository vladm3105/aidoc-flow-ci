# FRAMEWORK-TODO — `aidoc-flow-ci`

Canon inconsistencies / bugs / improvement notes discovered while driving
the docs + workflows. Logged inline as found (per the framework-TODO
convention — examples/adoption ARE the system-under-test; their friction is
the framework's truth). Each item names the surfaces + a fix sketch; clear
when resolved.

## Open

### FT-1 — Branch-protection templates lag REPO_STANDARDS §2 on `call / verify`

**Found:** 2026-07-09, during PLAN-004 PR-A3 (`BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` authoring).
**Surfaces:** `docs/REPO_STANDARDS.md` §2 (line ~84) lists `call / verify`
in the required-checks baseline for governance/product/ops; the shipped
`install/templates/branch-protection-{governance,product,ops}.json` omit
it (they predate the 2026-07-08 §2 amendment per §15 change log).
**Effect:** `apply-standards.sh --apply` produces protection WITHOUT
`call / verify`; a `--check` against §2 then reports it as drift; the doc
had to describe "§2 target vs template today" rather than one number.
**Constraint (why not a trivial template edit):** requiring `call / verify`
universally would block every PR on any tier repo that hasn't adopted the
`audit-trail` caller yet (per its §14.3 Wave). So the fix must couple the
template change to audit-trail adoption state, or keep `call / verify` a
per-repo post-adoption addition.
**Fix sketch:** decide the canonical position — either (a) §2 marks
`call / verify` as "add after audit-trail adoption" (matching current
templates + `BRANCH_PROTECTION.md`), or (b) ship the audit-trail caller
template + bump the three branch-protection templates together in a wave
that also flips required checks. Reconcile §2 ⇄ templates ⇄
`BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` so all three agree.

### FT-2 — Verify the real emitted context names for `pre-commit` + `secret-scan`

**Found:** 2026-07-09, PLAN-004 PR-A3 (pre-push review L1).
**Surfaces:** `docs/REPO_STANDARDS.md` §2 + the `branch-protection-*.json`
templates require contexts `Lint / format / security hooks` and
`Secret scan (gitleaks)`. But `secret-scan.yml`'s job name is `gitleaks`
and both are consumed via a caller `jobs.call:` job, so GitHub likely
renders them as `call / gitleaks` and `call / Lint / format / security
hooks`. If the required context string doesn't match what the check
actually posts, the required check never turns green → PR blocked.
**Fix sketch:** on one live PR that runs both reusables, read the actual
posted context names (`gh api repos/<r>/commits/<sha>/check-runs --jq
'.check_runs[].name'` or the PR's status contexts). If they differ from
the canon strings, correct §2 + every `branch-protection-*.json`. Doc
(`BRANCH_PROTECTION.md`) currently mirrors canon faithfully, so it self-
corrects once canon is fixed.

### FT-3 — `labels.json` `skip-ai-review` description contradicts behavior

**Found:** 2026-07-09, PLAN-004 PR-A3 (`LABELS.md` rewrite).
**Surface:** `install/templates/labels.json` describes `skip-ai-review` as
"Operator override to re-fire ai-review", but the actual behavior
(`ai-review.yml` SKIP_REVIEW + `composition.yml:110-117` carry-forward) is
**suppress-and-carry-forward** — the label SUPPRESSES the reviewer on
subsequent pushes and carries the prior approval forward.
**Effect:** the terse description ships to consumers + is misleading.
`LABELS.md` documents the correct behavior + flags the discrepancy.
**Fix sketch:** update the `labels.json` description to
"Human override: suppress the reviewer on later pushes; composition
carries the prior approval forward" and PATCH-tag (label description
change is additive/cosmetic).
