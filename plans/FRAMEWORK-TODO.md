# FRAMEWORK-TODO — `aidoc-flow-ci`

Canon inconsistencies / bugs / improvement notes discovered while driving
the docs + workflows. Logged inline as found (per the framework-TODO
convention — examples/adoption ARE the system-under-test; their friction is
the framework's truth). Each item names the surfaces + a fix sketch; clear
when resolved.

## Open

### FT-1 — Branch-protection templates lag REPO_STANDARDS §2 on `call / verify`

**RESOLVED (2026-07-12, PLAN-007 W2):** branch-protection templates + REPO_STANDARDS §2 corrected to the verified `call / …` emitted names (incl. `call / verify`); `tests/test_checknames.sh` guards against recurrence.

**Found:** 2026-07-09, during PLAN-004 PR-A3 (`BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` authoring).
**Surfaces:** `docs/REPO_STANDARDS.md` §2 (line ~84) lists `call / verify`
in the required-checks baseline for governance/product/ops; the shipped
`install/templates/branch-protection-{governance,product,ops}.json` omit
it (they predate the 2026-07-08 §2 amendment per §15 change log).
**Effect:** `apply-standards.sh --apply` produces protection WITHOUT
`call / verify`; a `--check` against §2 then reports it as drift; the doc
had to describe "§2 target vs template today" rather than one number.
**Constraint (why not a trivial template edit):** requiring `call / verify`
universally would block every PR on any tier repo that hasn't adopted the
`audit-trail` caller yet (per its §14.3 Wave). So the fix must couple the
template change to audit-trail adoption state, or keep `call / verify` a
per-repo post-adoption addition.
**Fix sketch:** decide the canonical position — either (a) §2 marks
`call / verify` as "add after audit-trail adoption" (matching current
templates + `BRANCH_PROTECTION.md`), or (b) ship the audit-trail caller
template + bump the three branch-protection templates together in a wave
that also flips required checks. Reconcile §2 ⇄ templates ⇄
`BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` so all three agree.

### FT-2 — Verify the real emitted context names for `pre-commit` + `secret-scan`

**RESOLVED (2026-07-12, PLAN-007 W2):** verified emitted check-names captured from live runs + recorded in REPO_STANDARDS §2 verified-names table; templates aligned; regression-tested.

**Found:** 2026-07-09, PLAN-004 PR-A3 (pre-push review L1).
**Surfaces:** `docs/REPO_STANDARDS.md` §2 + the `branch-protection-*.json`
templates require contexts `Lint / format / security hooks` and
`Secret scan (gitleaks)`. But `secret-scan.yml`'s job name is `gitleaks`
and both are consumed via a caller `jobs.call:` job, so GitHub likely
renders them as `call / gitleaks` and `call / Lint / format / security
hooks`. If the required context string doesn't match what the check
actually posts, the required check never turns green → PR blocked.
**Fix sketch:** on one live PR that runs both reusables, read the actual
posted context names (`gh api repos/<r>/commits/<sha>/check-runs --jq
'.check_runs[].name'` or the PR's status contexts). If they differ from
the canon strings, correct §2 + every `branch-protection-*.json`. Doc
(`BRANCH_PROTECTION.md`) currently mirrors canon faithfully, so it self-
corrects once canon is fixed.

### FT-3 — `labels.json` `skip-ai-review` description corrected \n\n**Found:** 2026-07-09, PLAN-004 PR-A3 (`LABELS.md` rewrite).\n**Status:** RESOLVED — 2026-07-12.\n**Resolution:** `install/templates/labels.json:20` now reads "Operator override:\nsuppress re-review and carry forward a valid prior approval" — matches the actual\nbehavior (`ai-review.yml` SKIP_REVIEW + `composition.yml:110-117` carry-forward).\n`LABELS.md` already documented the correct behavior; the stale description was\ncosmetic only.

### FT-4 — CHANGELOG back-catalog (v1.1.0–v1.6.0) not cut into per-tag `##` headers

**Found:** 2026-07-09, PLAN-004 PR-A4b (CHANGELOG restructure).
**Surface:** `CHANGELOG.md` — the 18 tags in the `ci/v1.1.0` … `ci/v1.6.0`
band (16 excluding the two `ci/v1.1.0-alpha.*` prereleases; note `ci/v1.1.4`
was never cut — a gap the executor should expect) have their entries under
`## Unreleased` as dated `###` sub-sections, not per-tag `## ci/vX.Y.Z`
headers. PR-A4b did the safe parts (deduped the
doubled `ci/v1.0.3` header; renamed `## Unreleased` → staging header for the
genuinely-unreleased post-v1.6.0 work; added the PLAN-004 A-series entry)
but did NOT promote the released back-catalog.
**Why deferred (PLAN-004 §6 R5):** PLAN-004 item 10 assumed every Unreleased
sub-section carried an inline tag — false: the ~20 top entries (2026-07-08
work) are untagged, and the interspersed doc-only entries don't map cleanly
to a tag. A sweep risks mislabeling release provenance. `ci/v1.0.6`↓ already
have correct `##` headers, so this is bounded to the v1.1.0–v1.6.0 band.
**Fix sketch:** reconcile against `git log --tags --oneline` (each tag →
its commit range → the entries in that range), promote each inline-tagged
`### … ci/vX.Y.Z …` to `## ci/vX.Y.Z — <date>`, and assign the untagged
doc-only entries to the release whose commit range contains them. Verify no
entry is dropped or duplicated (line-count + entry-count before/after).

### FT-5 — `standards-drift` can't verify branch-protection / actions-permissions — STILL OPEN (needs a PAT/App token, NOT a permissions line)

**STILL OPEN (re-checked 2026-07-17), and the "one-line fix" does not exist.**
PLAN-007 W2 (2026-07-12) was marked RESOLVED but only made the 403 *legible* —
it never granted the scope, so the gap stayed live and the banner hid it until
the pre-prod governance review. The obvious fix — add `administration: read` to
the drift job's `permissions:` — was **attempted 2026-07-17 and rejected by
actionlint**: `administration` is not a grantable `GITHUB_TOKEN` workflow-
permission scope at all (the enum is actions/attestations/checks/contents/
deployments/discussions/id-token/issues/packages/pages/pull-requests/
repository-projects/security-events/statuses). So `branches/*/protection` reads
**cannot** be authorized via the workflow token; they require a PAT or a GitHub
App installation token with `administration:read`, provided as a secret.

**Effect (still live):** `.github/workflows/standards-drift.yml` grants only
`contents: read`, so `check-standards-drift.sh`'s branch-protection +
actions-permissions reads `warn_uncheckable`-skip. The drift check does NOT
verify the exact server-side settings PLAN-001 governs. Load-bearing for
PLAN-010's detector.

**Fix (real):** mint an App installation token (or a fine-grained PAT) with
`administration:read` + `actions:read`, store it as a repo/org secret, and have
the workflow use it for the `gh api` reads instead of `GITHUB_TOKEN`. That is a
provisioning task (🔴, touches secrets), not a canon-code one-liner — which is
why it belongs with the PLAN-010 adoption-model work, not a drive-by.

**Lesson:** "made the error legible" ≠ "fixed the error"; and a fix sketch's own
caveat ("confirm GITHUB_TOKEN can read another repo's branch protection") is
worth executing before marking anything RESOLVED. actionlint caught the bad fix
in one run.

**Found:** 2026-07-09, PLAN-004 C1 review.
**Surface:** `.github/workflows/standards-drift.yml` job grants `contents: read`;
`sync/check-standards-drift.sh` makes `gh api` reads of `branches/*/protection`,
`actions/permissions*`, and repo settings — which need `administration: read`
(branch-protection needs admin). With only `contents: read` those calls
`warn_uncheckable`-skip, so the drift check emits `::warning::cannot check …`
instead of actually verifying those surfaces.
**Effect:** the scheduled drift check silently does NOT catch branch-protection
or actions-permissions drift — the exact settings PLAN-001 canon governs.
**Pre-existing** (not introduced by C1's `permissions: {}` addition).
**Fix sketch:** add `administration: read` (and `actions: read`) to the drift
job's `permissions:` so those checks run instead of warn-skipping. Confirm the
GITHUB_TOKEN can read another repo's branch protection, or document that it
requires a PAT/App token with admin:read for cross-repo drift.

### FT-6 — trust-config source inconsistency: `composition` reads `$GH_REPO@main`, ai-review/auto-merge read `trust_config_repo`

**VERIFIED not-an-enforcement-gap (2026-07-12, PLAN-007 W2):** re-read composition.yml — when a repo has no local `.github/ai-review/config.json`, the read falls to the `else` branch = **fail-closed, ENFORCE the App-approval requirement** (composition.yml ~213). The consumer-local config is read ONLY for the author-EXEMPTION path (exempt a non-trusted author as human-review-only); it fails safe. So composition enforces everywhere; the `GH_REPO`-vs-`trust_config_repo` difference is a low-priority consistency nit (unify the author-exemption source with ai-review's `trust_config_repo`), NOT a gate that silently passes. Downgraded from load-bearing.

**PARTIALLY RESOLVED:** 2026-07-10, PLAN-005 PR-G — the hardcoded `?ref=main` is
fixed: `composition.yml` now reads the config from the repo's **actual default
branch** (`gh api repos/$GH_REPO -q .default_branch`, fall back to `main`), so
`master`/`develop` consumers aren't degraded to always-enforce. STILL OPEN: the
*source-repo* half — composition reads the CONSUMER's own repo while
ai-review/auto-merge read `trust_config_repo` (they can still consult different
allowlists). The `trust_config_repo`/`trust_config_ref` inputs on composition
(fix sketch (a) below) remain a deliberate future decision.

**Found:** 2026-07-09, PLAN-004 D1 (trust-root parameterization).
**Surface:** after D1, `ai-review.yml` + `auto-merge-ai-prs.yml` read the trust
config (`.trust.ai_review` + `auto_merge.repos`) from `trust_config_repo` @
`trust_config_ref` (default `vladm3105/aidoc-flow-operations@main`). But
`composition.yml:156` reads `.trust.ai_review` from
`repos/$GH_REPO/contents/.github/ai-review/config.json?ref=main` — the
CONSUMER's own repo, hardcoded `?ref=main`.
**Effect:** the three gates can consult DIFFERENT allowlists. For aidoc-flow
(operations' central config vs a consumer's minimal `["vladm3105"]`) they may
diverge, so composition could exempt/enforce an author differently than
ai-review routed them. Not de-branded by D1 because composition has no hardcoded
operations ref (it's already consumer-relative), and switching it to
`trust_config_repo` is a BEHAVIOR change on a live security gate — deferred to a
deliberate decision, not a rushed breaking PR.
**Fix sketch:** decide the canonical trust-source model — either (a) composition
also reads `trust_config_repo`@`trust_config_ref` (aligning all three; a
behavior change for aidoc-flow that must be validated against the live gate), or
(b) document that composition intentionally uses the consumer's own config and
ai-review/auto-merge use the central one, with the reason. Reconcile + add the
`trust_config_repo`/`trust_config_ref` inputs to composition either way.

### FT-7 — `CODEOWNERS.template` still hardcodes `@vladm3105`; de-brand needs a handle-normalizing drift check

**RESOLVED:** 2026-07-09 — implemented approach (a) normalize. `CODEOWNERS.template`
owner routes → `@${CODEOWNER_HANDLE}`; `apply-standards.sh` gained
`codeowners_check` (`normalize_codeowners` maps every `@owner` → `@OWNER` on both
sides before diff, verifying path structure while ignoring handle identity);
`install.sh` now installs `.github/CODEOWNERS` (substituted, preserve-if-exists)
reusing D2's `substitute_placeholders`. Defaults byte-identical; existing
`@vladm3105` consumers keep passing. REPO_STANDARDS §7 + §16.7. Original entry
retained below for context.

**Found:** 2026-07-09, PLAN-004 D2 (de-brand install templates).
**Surface:** D2 parameterized `config.json.template` (`${CODEOWNER_HANDLE}`) and
`CLAUDE.md.template` (`${CANON_*_URL}`) because neither is exact-match
drift-checked (config.json is drift-exempt; CLAUDE.md drift is a structural
governance-table parse via `parse-governance-table.py`). `CODEOWNERS.template`
was deliberately LEFT branded: `apply-standards.sh` `exact_match_check`
(`.github/CODEOWNERS` vs `CODEOWNERS.template`) diffs byte-for-byte, so a
`${CODEOWNER_HANDLE}` placeholder in the template would read as permanent DRIFT
against a consumer's substituted `@handle` on every `--check`. It is also NOT
written by `install.sh` today (install.sh installs callers, config.json,
CLAUDE.md, pre_push_check, pre-commit, labels — no CODEOWNERS), and `@vladm3105`
is already correct for every current (vladm3105-owned) consumer, so leaving it
branded has zero impact on the live workspace.
**Effect:** a true external adopter must hand-edit `.github/CODEOWNERS` after
install; the handle there is not yet flag-parameterized.
**Fix sketch (drift-pipeline design decision — do deliberately):** pick one —
(a) **normalize** owner handles out of the CODEOWNERS comparison: strip
`@[\w/-]+` tokens (and map `${CODEOWNER_HANDLE}` on the template side) on BOTH
sides before `diff`, so the check verifies path-routing STRUCTURE (which is
canon) and ignores WHO owns (inherently consumer-specific) — needs no handle
plumbed into CI, and is semantically correct since the owner is not canon;
(b) **handle-aware:** thread `--codeowner` into `apply-standards.sh --check`
(read from a repo var or the consumer's own `* @handle` line) and substitute
before diff — more CI plumbing; (c) **structural:** downgrade CODEOWNERS from
exact to a presence/shape check. Recommended: (a). Then add a CODEOWNERS install
step to `install.sh` (fetch + `substitute_placeholders` + write
`.github/CODEOWNERS`) reusing the D2 substitution helper, and de-brand
`CODEOWNERS.template` to `${CODEOWNER_HANDLE}`. Defaults must stay byte-identical.

### FT-8 — migrate `sync/check-drift.sh` onto `manifest.json` (PLAN-004 PR-E2)

**RESOLVED (2026-07-16).** `sync/check-drift.sh` no longer hardcodes
`for wf in ai-review composition`. The loop is now driven by the consumer's own
pinned callers under `.github/workflows/*.yml` and resolved through
`manifest.json` **fetched at each caller's own pin** (preserving the PR-A2
per-caller pin frame — a mid-bump consumer must not be judged against a newer
caller's canon), with the warning-only contract intact. A newly-manifested canon
workflow is drift-checked without editing the script.

Verified against a simulated consumer: the old script reported **"no drift"** on
a consumer carrying three real drifts (`labeler` + `secret-scan` `concurrency`
block dropped, `pre-commit` `push:main` trigger dropped — the exact drifts the
filing reported as invisible); the new script flags all three by name.

**Coverage is the manifest's workflow surface, not "every canon workflow"** —
and the distinction was load-bearing: `audit-trail` shipped `-public`/`-private`
templates but had **no manifest entry**, so the OPS-0069 gate (deployed on 9/9
repos) resolved to nothing and was reported as an unknown caller. It was the only
such omission across the template set; `install/templates/manifest.json` now
manifests it, which also brings it into `install.sh --update`'s walk. Do not
restate coverage as complete without re-measuring against `manifest.json`.

The reporting contract was tightened in the same pass, because a drift tool that
reports a pass over files it never opened is the same defect class as the
secret-scan that greens while scanning nothing: every uncompared caller now
emits a `::warning::` and increments a skip counter, the verdict carries its
denominator (`compared N of M; S skipped`), and the words "no drift" are gated
on `SKIPPED == 0`. A canon caller pinned to a branch or bare SHA — previously
classified as consumer-owned and skipped in total silence — is now reported as
an unpinned canon caller. (This does not reach FT-13's unresolvable iplanic pin:
that is a `curl` in a `run:` step, not a `uses:`, so no `@ref` exists to scan.)

Scope limits are stated in the script header rather than left silent: non-pinned
canon surfaces (`.markdownlint.json`, `CODEOWNERS`, `CLAUDE.md`,
`scripts/pre_push_check.sh`, …) carry no tag for this per-pin tool to resolve
them at and are `apply-standards.sh --check`'s job; templates with `substitute`
placeholders are skipped (a raw diff would false-flag them); callers pinned
below `ci/v1.7.0` predate `manifest.json` and are reported as skipped, never as
clean.

**Found:** 2026-07-09, PLAN-004 PR-E (update path). PR-E shipped
`install/templates/manifest.json` + `install.sh --update` consuming it, but
scoped OUT the `sync/check-drift.sh` rewrite to keep the PR reviewable.
**Surface:** `sync/check-drift.sh:30` still uses a hardcoded
`for wf in ai-review composition` loop over the two auto-installed callers.
It should read the workflow surface from `manifest.json` (the same list
`install.sh --update` walks) so a newly-added canon workflow is drift-checked
without editing the script. The existing "bring back to canonical: remove the
local file + re-run install/install.sh" note (`sync/check-drift.sh:66`) can
point at `install.sh --update` as the reconciliation path.
**Effect:** drift-check coverage is limited to ai-review + composition;
optional adopted workflows (labeler, codeql, secret-scan, …) are not
drift-flagged by check-drift.sh (apply-standards.sh + check-standards-drift.sh
cover other surfaces). Non-breaking gap, not a correctness bug.
**Fix sketch:** replace the hardcoded loop with a `python3` walk of
`manifest.json` filtering to `.github/workflows/*` entries (visibility
resolved like `install.sh --update`), preserving the per-caller pin logic
(each caller compared against the tag IT is pinned to, per PR-A2) and the
warning-only/never-block contract. Reuse the manifest entry emission from
`install.sh update_mode`. Keep it a separate PR (E2) — it touches a live
CI drift-check script.

### FT-9 — 🔴 `install.sh --update` wholesale-replaces `safe_to_replace` callers, clobbering per-repo runner/permissions/trigger customizations

**Found:** 2026-07-10, during the PLAN-005 v1.8.1 consumer-sync sweep — a
fleet-wide gate-brick regression. Caught on operations #244 by that repo's own
ai-review (verdict: changes-requested); the identical regression had **already
merged** on iplanic (#247), business, and interlog before detection.
**Surface:** `install/install.sh` `update_mode()` (lines ~186-261): for any
manifest entry with `safe_to_replace: true` (all workflow callers except
`codeql.yml`), `--update` **overwrites the local caller file wholesale** with
the fetched generic template. The template ships the framework default
`runner_labels: '"runner-self"'` and omits per-repo caller `permissions:`
blocks, trigger customizations (`ready_for_review`, the `pull_request_review`
exclusion), and per-caller `runner_labels` overrides.
**Effect (critical):** running `--update` on a repo that has customized its
callers silently reverts those customizations. Concretely on the private
consumers, `runs-on: ${{ fromJSON(inputs.runner_labels_review) }}` became
`runs-on: runner-self` — a label no repo has registered (operations pool =
`self-hosted,aidoc,ci-ephemeral` + `…,ai-review`; iplanic = `…,ci-ephemeral`)
— so every required-check job (ai-review trust/review, composition,
doc-maintainer) queues indefinitely and **bricks the merge gate for every
subsequent PR**. Also drops docs-sync/links overrides → `ubuntu-latest`
fallback → OPS-0049 billing gate-down, and deletes doc-maintainer's
`permissions:` block → startup_failure.
**Root confusion:** `--update` conflates two distinct operations — "adopt a new
canon **template body**" vs "bump the **pin version**." A **re-pin is
version-only**: it must change only the `@ci/vX.Y.Z` string on each `uses:`
line and touch nothing else.
**Fix sketch:** split the two. Either (a) add a dedicated `--repin` path that
surgically rewrites `@ci/v*` → target tag on existing caller `uses:` lines,
preserving all customizations (the manual fix applied to operations #244 +
iplanic); or (b) mark all workflow callers `safe_to_replace: false` in
`manifest.json` so `--update` only reports body drift (never auto-replaces) and
handles the pin bump separately; or (c) make `update_mode` merge — preserve the
consumer's `with:` block (runner_labels/permissions/trigger overrides) while
adopting non-`with:` template changes. Requires a plan (canon change → semver
MINOR + `REPO_STANDARDS.md` update + verified-planning 2-cycle review). Until
shipped: **never run `install.sh --update` for a re-pin on a repo with a
customized caller — do a surgical `@ci/v*` sed instead.**
**RESOLVED (ci/v1.9.0, PLAN-006 W2):** `-private.yml` templates now ship the real
`ci-ephemeral` array (no more `runner-self` placeholder); `install.sh --repin`
(version-only pin bump) added — option (a). See CHANGELOG v1.9.0.

### FT-10 — `runner-self` still used as a pool-nickname across reference docs

**Found:** 2026-07-11, v1.9.0 doc-consistency review (documentation-specialist).
**Surface:** after v1.9.0 removed `runner-self` from the shipped templates, the
reference docs still use `runner-self` as the *nickname* for the self-hosted pool
in several places: `docs/runners.md` §0/§2 pool tables + registration steps
(~lines 91, 103, 122, 152-191), `docs/troubleshooting.md:95-96/286`,
`LABELS.md:121`. Not a contradiction with the template change (the genuine
"templates ship runner-self" claims were fixed in v1.9.0), but `runner-self` is
**not registered on any runner**. The **canonical label is
`["self-hosted","ci-runner","single-use"]`** (CI-0007, since v2.0.0 — see
`DECISIONS.md`). NB the older `aidoc,ci-ephemeral` nickname is ALSO retired; this
entry previously named it as "the real labels", which would have made this
doc-fix install a second wrong nickname — fix the docs to the CI-0007 labels.
**Effect:** a reader following runners.md registration steps would register a
`runner-self` label no caller targets. Educational drift, not a live break.
**Fix sketch:** reconcile the nickname — rewrite the reference docs to the real
`ci-ephemeral`/`ai-review` labels throughout (align docs to infra; preferred).
One focused docs PR; split to keep ≤3 surfaces.

### FT-11 — graduate `markdown-lint` (report-only → blocking) + `docs-sync` (dry-run → live)

**Found:** 2026-07-11, PLAN-006 W4 population. **Status: population DONE;
graduations remain.**
**Done:** the canon defect was fixed (`v1.9.4` binary-install for
`markdown-lint`+`links`; `v1.9.5` `markdown-lint` `fail-on-findings` toggle +
`.lychee.toml` `include_fragments` fix), and all content-check workflows are
now deployed on every active repo (see `docs/WORKFLOWS.md` §2):
- **`links`** — blocking (offline) on every repo (0 errors; debt repos ship a
  scoping `.lychee.toml`).
- **`markdown-lint`** — deployed **report-only** (`fail-on-findings: false`);
  operations/framework covered by own tooling.
- **`docs-sync`** — deployed **dry-run** (proposes doc-fixes as a PR comment;
  no App needed — the `aidoc-flow-bot` App is only for the live Apply step).

**Remaining (deliberate opt-in graduations, NOT dev gaps):**
- **`markdown-lint` report-only → blocking — DONE across all canon consumers
  (PLAN-007 W3, 2026-07-12).** Sequence: (1) founder chose to **relax the canon
  `.markdownlint.json`** (disable MD013/MD024/MD036 — workspace-legitimate
  false-positives on changelog data rows, keep-a-changelog headings, ADR
  `**Context**`/`**Decision**` bold-labels; ci #149, REPO_STANDARDS §4.4). (2)
  Per-repo graduation to `fail-on-findings: true`: **business #57, interlog #63,
  engramory #49, iplan-runner #89, iplanic #258, iplan-standard #30 all
  MERGED** (iplan-standard is governance tier — OPS-0062-excluded from AI
  auto-merge, so the founder merged it). operations + framework are covered-by-own-tooling (not the canon
  reusable). **Key lesson: a blind `markdownlint-cli2 --fix` is UNSAFE on these
  docs** — it corrupts prose (a literal `+`/`#` at line-start misread as a
  list/heading marker → MD004/MD001 cascades) and code identifiers
  (`__init__.py`→`**init**.py` via MD050). Every graduation reflowed the prose-`+`
  roots first, used `--fix` only for genuinely-structural rules, and ran a
  documentation-specialist to verify zero prose changed (it caught real MD050
  BLOCKERs on iplan-runner + iplanic; the pre-commit `check_plan` gate caught
  `--fix` breaking verified-planning ledger citations twice). engramory added a
  repo-local `MD025.front_matter_title:""` for its `sdd/**` frontmatter-titled
  docs. **Still pending: arming each as a required status check = the
  founder-executed W4 step** (`docs/FLEET_BRANCH_PROTECTION_ARMING.md`; FT-12).
- **`docs-sync` dry-run → live.** 🔴 founder provisions `aidoc-flow-bot` App +
  `AIDOC_FLOW_BOT_ID`/`KEY` secrets per repo, then set `dry_run: false`. Weigh
  against the pending `doc-maintainer.yml` supersession at `ci/v2.0.0` — the
  dry-run adoptions may migrate to `doc-maintainer` rather than each graduating.

Ties to [[reference_canon_workflow_hard_constraints]] #3.

### FT-12 — fleet branch-protection arming anomalies (PLAN-007 W4 survey)

**Found:** 2026-07-12, PLAN-007 W4 read-only survey. Runbook:
`docs/FLEET_BRANCH_PROTECTION_ARMING.md`. Arming itself is 🔴 (founder-executed).
Three sub-issues the survey surfaced that need canon/repo remediation
independent of the arming act:

- **Phantom required-context (framework, business, iplanic).** Each arms a
  **bare** `Lint / format / security hooks` required-check but emits the canon
  `call / Lint / format / security hooks` → the bare context never posts, so
  these repos have been merging via `--admin`. Fix = re-point the required
  context to the emitted name (in the runbook's step B).
- **iplan-runner canon adoption — RESOLVED (iplan-runner #88, 2026-07-12).**
  `call / gitleaks` was failing on a placeholder HMAC key in the
  `iplanic-vectors/` conformance vectors (the canon default allowlist matches a
  bare `vectors/` but not the compound dir name). Fixed consumer-side via
  `config-path: .gitleaks.toml` + a proper `[extend] useDefault=true` allowlist
  (which also un-broke the repo's previously rule-less, no-op standalone
  gitleaks). On the fix PR, `call / ai-review` + `call / composition` ran green —
  the earlier "skipped" was PR-specific, not a wiring defect. Its canon `call/…`
  gates are now armable.
  - _Canon observation (low-priority):_ the reusable's default gitleaks
    allowlist path `(^|/)(vectors|fixtures|testdata|examples)/` misses compound
    names like `*-vectors/`. The `config-path` escape hatch is the intended
    per-consumer fix, so leaving the canon default strict (opt-in) is defensible;
    broadening it fleet-wide risks over-suppression. No action unless a second

### FT-13 — private-repo standards-drift callers are broken; one pins an unresolvable SHA

**Found:** 2026-07-16, triaging the `llm-router` flowci-feedback filing.
**Surfaces:** `.github/workflows/standards-drift.yml` (fleet pin-currency step);
the consumer-side callers in operations / business / iplanic / interlog.

**The mechanism exists.** `sync/check-standards-drift.sh` chains
`check-pin-currency.sh` itself (uses `sync/check-pin-currency.sh` if present
locally, else `curl`s it from `${CI_TAG}`), so a private repo running
standards-drift gets pin-currency transitively without naming it in the caller.
Canon's own fleet audit cannot cover the private repos — `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot
read private repo contents — so the per-repo run is the intended path.

**Verified facts (2026-07-16). Only these; see the caution below.**

1. **`business` and `interlog` have no `standards-drift.yml` at all** — so they
   get no drift and no pin-currency signal from any source.
2. **`iplanic`'s caller pins a SHA that can never resolve.**
   `e15ec7d44234726195da316a740ad1684a2c5abd` is the **annotated tag object** of
   `ci/v1.6.0`, not a commit: `gh api repos/…/commits/e15ec7d…` returns `422 No
   commit found`, and raw.githubusercontent has never served it (HTTP 404). The
   commit the tag dereferences to is `e827ab8268917ea4a81a0b8ddbc59eace702f7ed`,
   which serves HTTP 200 today. So this is a **permanent authoring bug, not
   decay** — the caller has never worked, and "re-pin it to a live tag" is the
   wrong fix. The right one is to deref the tag
   (`gh api repos/<r>/git/refs/tags/<tag> --jq '.object.sha'` returns the TAG
   object for an annotated tag; dereference via `git/tags/<sha> --jq
   '.object.sha'`, or just pin the tag name).
3. **Every private standards-drift run on record has failed** (latest:
   2026-07-13). None is presently producing a signal.

**Caution — this entry has now been wrong three times; do not add a fourth
without measuring.** (a) The original comment claimed the private four were
"covered by their OWN weekly run, which chains check-pin-currency.sh in-repo" —
true for operations, false for the rest. (b) Its first correction over-swung to
"none of them chains pin-currency" — false for operations; that measurement
grepped only the caller YAML and missed the chain one level down, inside the
script the caller invokes. (c) Its second correction attributed operations'
2026-07-13 failure to its current checkout-based caller — but that caller was
authored **2026-07-16**, after the run. At the time of the failure operations
was `curl`-ing the same unresolvable `e15ec7d…` URL as iplanic, so the two had
the *same* bug, not different ones. **operations' current caller has never run**;
whether its chain works is unproven by inspection alone.

The checks each miss would have needed: grep the transitive path, not just the
caller; and confirm the cited run actually executed the caller you are
describing (`gh api "repos/<r>/commits?path=<workflow>"` vs the run's
`createdAt`).

**Why it matters:** a consumer that cannot fetch its drift script has no drift
signal and no indication that it has none — the same absent-feedback-loop shape
as the fleet-wide `enforce_admins` drift. Note this specific shape is NOT caught
by `sync/check-drift.sh`, even after the 2026-07-16 coverage work: iplanic
references canon via a `curl` inside a `run:` step, not a `uses:`, so there is no
`@ref` for the caller-scan to see. Reporting unresolvable canon references in
`run:` steps is unsolved.

**Fix sketch (needs a decision, hence a plan not a patch):** the filing proposed
adding `sync/*.sh` to `manifest.json` so every consumer gets a copy. Copying a
script into every consumer manufactures another drifting surface — and the
hand-rolled callers above are what that looks like in practice. The alternative
is a canon reusable + a thin caller template that resolves the scripts at the
consumer's pinned tag, matching how every other canon surface is consumed and
getting version-pinning (and drift-checking, now that callers are
manifest-resolved) for free — and removing the class of bug in (2) entirely,
since a `uses:` pin cannot be an unresolvable tag object. Choosing between them —
and deciding whether `install.sh` should apply server-side standards at all (🔴:
it mutates consumer repos) — is the scope of the adoption-model plan (next free
PLAN number). Consumer-side callers are cross-repo work and go through the
ops/inbox runbook, never a direct edit from a canon session.

### FT-14 — `pre_push_check.sh`'s yamllint is stricter than canon's own CI gate, so canon fails its own hook

**Found:** 2026-07-16, running `scripts/pre_push_check.sh` while closing the
flowci-feedback findings.
**Surfaces:** `scripts/pre_push_check.sh` §2 (yamllint); `tests/test_lint.sh:20-23`;
the absent `install/templates/.yamllint.yaml`.

**Two invocations of the same tool disagree:**

- `tests/test_lint.sh:22` — canon's **authoritative** gate (runs in `tests.yml`
  on every PR) invokes yamllint with an explicit relaxed profile:
  `line-length: disable, document-start: disable, truthy: disable, …`. Its own
  comment says *"yamllint relaxed (no line-length…)"*. It is green on `main`.
- `scripts/pre_push_check.sh:98-101` — falls back to a **bare `yamllint`** when
  no `.yamllint.yaml` exists. Canon has none, so the hook enforces line-length
  and every rule the CI gate deliberately disabled.

**Effect:** measured 2026-07-16 on pristine `main`, bare yamllint reports **172
issues** across `.github/workflows/`, so `pre_push_check.sh` **exits non-zero on
an unmodified canon checkout**. Anyone with yamllint installed who runs the hook
is told not to push work that canon's own CI accepts. The hook is not currently
installed as a git hook in every checkout, which is the only reason this has not
blocked anyone — i.e. the local gate is inert where it is wrong, and wrong where
it is not inert.

**Relation to the filing.** This is flowci-feedback's *"install.sh ships no
default `.yamllint.yaml`"* finding. That entry was assessed as **inert for
consumers** and that assessment holds — `install.sh` never installs yamllint, so
a fresh consumer's check 2 skips-with-notice and no consumer-facing CI runs
yamllint at all. But it is **not** inert for **canon**, which has yamllint
available and no config. The filing reasoned from consumer symptoms and reached
the right fix shape for the wrong repo.

**Fix sketch (a decision, not a patch — hence not done here):** the profile is
already chosen and proven; `tests/test_lint.sh:22` is the de-facto canon
yamllint config. Either (a) extract that inline `-d` profile into a repo-root
`.yamllint.yaml` and have both call sites read it — one source of truth, and
`pre_push_check.sh`'s existing `-f .yamllint.yaml` branch (dead code today,
never exercised in canon) starts working; or (b) leave canon's config absent and
make the hook's fallback match the relaxed profile. Prefer (a). Whether the same
file also ships to consumers via `install/templates/` + `manifest.json` is the
separable question the filing actually asked, and it should be settled with the
adoption-model plan rather than as a drive-by: shipping a lint config to repos
that do not run the linter adds a drift surface for no signal.
