# ROADMAP — aidoc-flow-ci

Forward-looking view of the workspace CI + governance-workflow canon
library.

Sequenced by phase, not by month. Update in place when a phase closes;
deferred items belong in `plans/` or `HANDOFF.md` open threads.

---

## Current phase — v2.1.x shipped; founder-gated fleet rollout

`ci/v2.1.2` is cut + released (Latest). The pre-prod hardening that made the
canon production-ready as the company-default source of truth is done and
released, together with the ai-review large-diff fix a consumer hit live. The
only remaining work is the **founder-gated fleet rollout** (re-pin the fleet to
`ci/v2.1.2` + arm branch protection on the 5 unprotected/phantom-context repos)
— 🔴 cross-repo, tracked in operations #268. READ
`HANDOFF.md` for the live rollout state.

| Milestone | Status |
|---|---|
| Pre-prod canon-side blockers (composition parse-bypass, backwards-repin, half-provisioned brick, `-private` variants, adopter docs) | DONE — shipped in `ci/v2.1.0` (#175–#177) |
| ai-review large-diff hardening (PLAN-011: `max_tokens` budget + honest `ai:review-infra-error` signal) | DONE — shipped in `ci/v2.1.1` (`max_tokens` 4096→8192) + `ci/v2.1.2` (→24576) |
| Fleet re-pin to `ci/v2.1.2` | Founder + ops/inbox (🔴 cross-repo; operations #268) |
| Server-side pre-prod blockers (composition-required on business/iplanic; branch protection on the 3 unprotected repos incl. canon) | Founder + ops/inbox (cross-repo) |
| PLAN-007 W4 fleet branch-protection arming | Founder-gated |
| PLAN-007 W3 docs-sync dry-run → live | Founder-gated (App provisioning or doc-maintainer supersession) |
| PLAN-008 pre-prod gap closure | COMPLETE (v2.0.0 cut) |
| PLAN-009 fleet v2 cutover | In flight (Phase 0 🔴-gated; target now `ci/v2.1.2`) |
| PLAN-010 adoption model | DRAFT — NOT READY (split recommended; see the plan) |
| PLAN-011 ai-review large-diff hardening | SHIPPED (`ci/v2.1.1` + `v2.1.2`) |

**Recently landed:**

- 2026-07-17 — `ci/v2.1.2` cut: ai-review verdict budget raised 8192→24576
  (PLAN-011 follow-up; live-verified headroom for reasoning-token spikes).
- 2026-07-17 — `ci/v2.1.1` cut: ai-review large-diff fix (PLAN-011) — verdict
  `max_tokens` 4096→8192 so reasoning tokens no longer truncate the verdict
  JSON, plus a new `ai:review-infra-error` label/comment so a residual reviewer
  failure surfaces honestly instead of as a fake `CHANGES_REQUESTED`.
- 2026-07-17 — `ci/v2.1.0` cut: pre-prod canon-side blockers closed (#175–#177):
  composition malformed-config bypass, `--repin`-backwards + version-sync guard,
  half-provisioned brick, 6 `-private` variants, adopter cold-start docs.
- 2026-07-15 — `ci/v2.0.1` cut: ai-review v2 blocker fixes (request_changes jq,
  review-event bypass, python3 preflight).
- 2026-07-13 — `ci/v2.0.0` cut: LiteLLM unification (breaking).
- 2026-07-12 — `feat/unified-litellm-agents` merged (#154): dependency-free
  LiteLLM adapter, config schema v2, real-proxy smoke workflow.
- 2026-07-12 — PLAN-007 W3 markdown-lint graduation: canon `.markdownlint.json`
  relaxed (MD013/MD024/MD036), all 6 consumers graduated to blocking.
- 2026-07-12 — PLAN-007 W1/W2/W5: test suite (#143), guardrails (#144/#145),
  Dependabot prune (#137).
- 2026-07-11 — PLAN-006 W4 content-check population COMPLETE across all active repos.
- 2026-07-10 — PLAN-004 SHIPPED (`ci/v1.7.0`): company-default elevation with
  A-series docs, B correctness, C security, D de-brand + trust-root, E
  install `--update`.
- 2026-07-10 — PLAN-005 SHIPPED (`ci/v1.7.1` → `v1.8.1`): governance floor,
  skip carry-forward, trust-root parameterization, App-native trust fetch.
- 2026-07-08 — PLAN-003 governance-canon SHIPPED: flexible-canonical rule +
  5 templates + parser + Wave 0 self-adoption.
- 2026-07-08 — PLAN-002 workspace standards + self-review enforcement SHIPPED.

## Next phase — post-v2.1.x canon evolution

Once the fleet is on `ci/v2.1.2`, next phase closes the server-side pre-prod
items (branch protection, required-check parity) and evolves the canon based on
consumer feedback.

**Planned initiatives:**

- **W4 fleet branch-protection arming** — arm the now-blocking checks as
  required across all consumers. Founder-executed; runbook at
  `docs/FLEET_BRANCH_PROTECTION_ARMING.md`.
- **W3 docs-sync dry-run → live** — provision `aidoc-flow-bot` App or fold
  into `doc-maintainer.yml` supersession.
- **Canon label sync** — reconcile label taxonomies across the 9
  non-paused repos (some use `bug/enhancement/documentation`, others
  use `feat/fix/chore/docs`). Canon should ship a preferred set +
  install helper.
- **Reusable branch-protection auditor** — GHA workflow that reports
  drift between each consumer's actual branch-protection rules and
  the canonical templates (`branch-protection-*.json` in `install/`).

---

## Deferred / parked

- **Multi-tier reusable AI-review** — different review depth per
  tier (governance = adversarial; ops-private = standard; product =
  light). Deferred: current single-tier flow works; multi-tier adds
  configuration complexity without clear pull.
- **Cross-repo dependency tracking** — auto-detect submodule pins vs
  latest tags across the workspace + surface staleness in a
  dashboard. Deferred: manual bumps work at current scale; automation
  is speculative until submodule velocity increases.
- **CI runtime metrics** — per-workflow duration + cost tracking.
  Deferred: no budget pressure.

---

**Maintenance protocol:**

- When PLAN-003 rollout closes, promote "Next phase" to "Current
  phase"; move landed items to git commit history (or DECISIONS.md if
  the phase outcome was itself a load-bearing decision).
- Do NOT accumulate — a roadmap that grows longer every quarter is a
  backlog in disguise.
