# HANDOFF — aidoc-flow-ci

Live cross-session resume point for the workspace CI + governance-workflow
canon library. Read at session start; refresh at milestones and before
context compaction.

## Current state (2026-07-10)

**PLAN-004 (company-default elevation) — SHIPPED (`ci/v1.7.0`, 2026-07-10).**
**`ci/v1.7.1` PATCH in flight** — PLAN-005 PR-B / B2: the `ai-review` caller
templates shipped with no `permissions:` block → `startup_failure` on consumers
under the canon `read` default (the pipeline never ran). Fixed by adding the
caller `permissions:` block to both variants. Consumers re-pin `@ci/v1.7.1` or
`install.sh --update`. **PLAN-005 REVISED to rev 2** (2026-07-10) after a
three-agent from-scratch review: PR-B marked SHIPPED (v1.7.1); D2 redesigned
(HEAD-relative + §15-safe — the original was both a live bypass AND broke §15
recovery); PR-E reversed (don't flip `trust_config_repo` default — it breaks the
enforcer schema + weakens trust); PR-C collapsed to a preventive guard; stale
PLAN-004 cross-refs corrected; added D7 (inert gov knobs) + D8/§Release
(propagate fixes to the ~9 consumers via `install.sh --update`). Gate: 28
citations, 3 passes. **PLAN-005 execution in progress:** PR-A part 1 (enforcer
governance floor — closes the gov-path double-label bypass) MERGED #108; PR-C
(remote tag-existence guard, `--check-published`) MERGED #109. **Remaining:**
PR-A part 2 (D2 HEAD-relative carry-forward — needs a LIVE §15 label-cycle smoke
test); PR-D (reviewer-engine↔token — FOUNDER DECISION: default `codex` vs
`claude`, + which token is actually set on consumers); PR-E (external-adopter
override docs + public-path EXPERIMENTAL disposition); PR-F (bootstrap guard +
D7 gov-knobs wire-or-annotate decision); PR-G (`composition ?ref=main` →
default-branch-agnostic — `.github/` gate change). Plus the §Release propagation
sweep (`install.sh --update` to the ~9 consumers for the v1.7.1 caller fix — 🔴
write-to-other-repos, needs the ops inbox runbook). FT-8 post-elevation;
FT-1..FT-6 remain.
A 5-agent pre-prod review of this repo → SHIP-WITH-FIXES; the fix plan
(`plans/PLAN-004_company-default-elevation.md`, merged #82) sequences A1–A6
(docs) → B (correctness) → C (security) → D (de-brand + trust-root) → E
(install `--update`). Merged so far:

- **A-series** (#83–#90, wrap #91): all adopter docs + governance + CHANGELOG,
  plus the drift-check per-caller fix.
- **B-series** (correctness): B1 #92 (doc-maintainer schedule bug — reconcile
  split into own job + dedup fall-through), B2 #93 (composition author via
  gh-api — `workflow_run.pull_requests[].user` is ABSENT), B3 #94 (fork-safety:
  labeler→pull_request_target, codeql/secret-scan skip-upload-on-fork), B4 #95
  (timeout-minutes on 12 reusables + apply-standards label %3A-encode +
  audit-trail fetch diag + troubleshooting §16-18).
- **C-series** (security): C1 #96 (SHA-pins + npm pin + curl|bash + drift
  permissions), C2 #97 (env-var indirection), C3 #98 (BL-3 auto-merge
  composition-armed gate — closes hand-applied-label bypass, preserves
  stuck-green recovery).
- **D1** #99 (BL-2 trust-root parameterization — trust_config_repo/ref inputs;
  defaults byte-identical).
- **D2** (de-brand install templates): `config.json.template`
  (`${CODEOWNER_HANDLE}`) + `CLAUDE.md.template` (`${CANON_OPERATIONS_URL}` ×7 /
  `${CANON_CI_URL}` ×1) parameterized; `install.sh` `--codeowner` /
  `--canon-operations-url` / `--canon-ci-url` flags + `python3` literal
  substitution (argv, not interpolated) + fail-closed post-sub assertion;
  defaults byte-identical (round-trip verified). REPO_STANDARDS §16.7.
  **Scope correction vs the pre-D2 HANDOFF/plan:** CLAUDE.md is NOT
  exact-match drift-checked (it's a structural governance-table parse) and
  config.json isn't drift-checked at all — so both parameterize with zero
  drift risk. The feared "drift-pipeline redesign" applied ONLY to
  `CODEOWNERS.template` (the only de-brand template that is content
  drift-checked, and it was not install-written) — done as **FT-7**.
- **FT-7** (CODEOWNERS de-brand): `CODEOWNERS.template` owner routes →
  `@${CODEOWNER_HANDLE}`; `apply-standards.sh` `codeowners_check` normalizes
  every `@owner` → `@OWNER` on both sides before diff (verifies path
  structure, ignores handle identity — approach (a)); `install.sh` now
  installs `.github/CODEOWNERS` (substituted, preserve-if-exists). Defaults
  byte-identical; existing `@vladm3105` consumers keep passing. REPO_STANDARDS
  §7 + §16.7.
- **E** (update path + manifest): new `install/templates/manifest.json` (the
  index of every `template → consumer-file` mapping: path, template +
  visibility variants, `substitute`, `safe_to_replace`) + `install.sh --update`
  mode walking it (re-fetch adopted surfaces → substitute → diff →
  `[k]eep/[r]eplace/[d]iff-only`; `--non-interactive` replaces only
  `safe_to_replace` = workflow callers + dependabot, keeps policy/governance;
  atomic replace; idempotent). New `docs/UPDATE_GUIDE.md`; REPO_STANDARDS
  §16.8. The `sync/check-drift.sh` manifest migration is scoped OUT to **FT-8**
  (E2) to keep this PR reviewable — no broken intermediate (check-drift.sh
  still works on its hardcoded loop).

✅ **`ci/v1.7.0` tag + GitHub release cut 2026-07-10** (on `f424aa7`, the PR-E
merge — all A–E under one cut). VERSION + docs + the `curl …/ci/v1.7.0/…`
install URLs now resolve. Post-cut verification: run a live `install.sh
--update` against one real consumer (e.g. interlog).

Earlier canon layers SHIPPED: **PLAN-003** (governance-file canon, #73–#75 +
follow-ups #76–#80) and **PLAN-002** (workspace standards + self-review
enforcement, PR-U1/U2/U3/U4, 2026-07-08).

## Open threads

- **PLAN-004 SHIPPED (A–E + `ci/v1.7.0` tag/release, 2026-07-10).** All A–E
  slices landed under the one cut (VERSION = `ci/v1.7.0`; the plan's per-slice
  `v1.8.0`/`v1.9.0` numbers were aspirational — D2 + FT-7 + E are
  additive/byte-identical, not breaking). The `curl …/ci/v1.7.0/…` install URLs
  now resolve. Remaining verification: a live end-to-end `install.sh --update`
  against a real consumer (e.g. interlog).
- **`plans/FRAMEWORK-TODO.md`** — FT-1 (branch-protection templates lag
  REPO_STANDARDS §2 on `call / verify`), FT-2 (verify `pre-commit`/`secret-scan`
  emitted context names), FT-3 (`labels.json` `skip-ai-review` description),
  FT-4 (CHANGELOG back-catalog per-tag cut), FT-5 (drift job needs
  `administration: read`), FT-6 (composition trust-source not parameterized —
  reads `$GH_REPO@main`; fails safe), FT-8 (migrate `sync/check-drift.sh` onto
  `manifest.json` = PLAN-004 E2). FT-1..FT-6 + FT-8 are now open backlog (the
  elevation shipped without them; none block adoption). **FT-7 (CODEOWNERS
  de-brand) RESOLVED 2026-07-09.**
- **PLAN-003 per-repo rollout waves** — one PR per non-paused repo per
  PLAN-003 §5.5 / operations `docs/CROSS_REPO_PLAYBOOKS.md` §T-D. Wave status
  is tracked there (do not hardcode a "next wave" here — it drifts). Validation
  gate: zero drift via the curl-piped `apply-standards.sh --check` (see
  `docs/PLAYBOOK_governance-canon-rollout.md`).

## Next-session start-here

1. **PLAN-004 SHIPPED — A–E merged + `ci/v1.7.0` tag/release cut 2026-07-10.**
   Next: (a) live `install.sh --update` against one real consumer (e.g.
   interlog) as post-cut verification; (b) follow-ups FT-8 (migrate
   `sync/check-drift.sh` onto `manifest.json`, = E2) + the pending FT-1..FT-6.
   Cap review/fix loops at 3 per OPS-0066.
2. For PLAN-003 rollout work, read `docs/PLAYBOOK_governance-canon-rollout.md`
   then defer to operations `docs/CROSS_REPO_PLAYBOOKS.md` §T-D for
   authoritative per-wave scope.
3. `docs/REPO_STANDARDS.md` is the durable canon consumers follow.
